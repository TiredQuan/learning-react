## Introduction
This is a collection of projects and tests from the Scrimba react.js tutorial that I've been following, implemented by me and guided by Scrimba and the mentor Bob



## Update

10/10/2022

I've done the project till project 4 about now

And I'm trying to put all the projects into one Jumbo App that has everything neatly tied together in a highlight reel of sorts

But currently having difficulties on it

It is now nighttime and finally figured out what I did wrong

Just got done with Project 5
usestate is a little weird to me but I kind of like it to be honest
a state is a mutable prop, and can change while displaying in the app, seemingly not requiring a rerender
