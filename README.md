I've done the project till project 4 about now

And I'm trying to put all the projects into one Jumbo App that has everything neatly tied together in a highlight reel of sorts

But currently having difficulties on it

It is now nighttime and finally figured out what I did wrong

Section 3 of the react course seems a bit "How do you do fellow kids" for me, So i'm just gonna do something that looks similar but is kind of not at the same time

maybe linking this to unspash or something
